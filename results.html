                <h1>Results</h1>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>Before explaining the results with numbers, we would like to thank you for your cooperation. You have exceeded the economic expectations that we proposed at the beginning!
                    <p><b>Thank you very much for the confidence deposited in our (and yours) project.</b></p>
                        At first, we calculated a budget to cover the purchase, printing, and shipping costs of 80 shirts to Anantapur. The breakdown of our budget was as follows:</p>
                        <div class="text-center who-we-are padding-bottom padding-top">
                                <div class="row">
                                    <div class="col-sm-4">
                                        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/about/image.png" alt="" />
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="col-sm-4">
                                            <p class="lead"> </p>
                                        <p> Almost at the end of the collection period, we noted that the contributions were generous, and decided to extend the purchase to 100 t-shirts; We wanted to be cautious when expanding the number of t-shirts because we did not know if there could be unexpected incidents when shipping them to India. Finally, <b>the real investment in smiles has been the following:</b></p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="col-sm-4">
                                        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/about/image-2.png" alt="" />
                                    </div>
                                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                    <p>Therefore, we observe a deviation of <b>€ 25</b> between what we budgeted and what was finally invested. Surprisingly, during the last few days we received a wave of donations that increased the total received to <b>€ 1,040</b>, leaving a surplus of <b>€ 415</b>.</p>
                    <p>At first, we thought about buying and printing more t-shirts right there in India, but the little time we had and the needed logistic were not in our favor and we found it impossible. </p>
                    <p>This is why we would like to invite you to participate in a survey to choose, among all the t-shirt donors, a project to invest the remaining 415 €. We have chosen the following 4 options:</p>

                    <p>If you want to propose another activity where to allocate your donations, do not hesitate to write us to the e-mail: <a href="mailto:femsomriure.contacte@gmail.com "><font color=green>femsomriure.contacte@gmail.com</font></a>  and we will add your proposal to the list. </p>
                    <p>Once again, <h5><b>THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING US AND MAKING POSSIBLE THIS SOLIDARY PROJECT</b></h5></p>

                    <p>Do not go away yet because we lack the last thanks:</p>
                    <p>Additionally to the t-shirt project, we proposed you to collaborate on the initiative that the Vicente Ferrer Foundation carries out to raise money to buy bicycles, so that children who live far from schools can move more easily from their residences.</p>
                    <p>Initially, we were informed about the long distances and the forms of travel available in the region and we found out about the very good project that it is. And it was during our stay in Andhra Pradesh and in India in general, where we were able to see more about the ease and the good that makes them children have their own way of travel. </p>
                    <p><b>We received donations specifically for 20 bicycles, that is, € 1,000 in total! </b></p>
                    <p>Once we receive the photos of the children with the bicycles, we will send them to you :D</p>
                    <p>Once again, <b>THANK YOU FOR TRUSTING US AND MAKING POSSIBLE THIS SOLIDARY PROJECT</b></p>
